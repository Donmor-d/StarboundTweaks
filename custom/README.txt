This file is for custom items, scripts, etc. They dont modify existing Starbound files
-celestial adds images for stars for "celestial.config" to use, in this case black holes.
 (note: modifying "celestial.config" corrupts the universe file on uninstall, so before and after installing the file should be deleted)
